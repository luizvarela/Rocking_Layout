Why do all my images (slides) display briefly when the page loads?
When a web page depends on JavaScript for DOM manipulation or styling, you may see a "flash of unstyle content" because the browser may render elements before the DOM is fully loaded and before the DOMContentLoaded event is fired. Karl Swedberg wrote a nice article on this problem and how to avoid it. Karl talks about a general purpose solution, but for Cycle the solution is much simpler: just hide all but your first slideshow image using CSS.
For example:

#slideshow img { display: none }
#slideshow img.first { display: block }
...

<div id="slideshow">
	<img src="image1.jpg" width="200" height="200" class="first" />
	<img src="image2.jpg" width="200" height="200" />
	<img src="image3.jpg" width="200" height="200" />
</div>
